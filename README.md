# Welcome!

This repository is in charge of the CyBear Jinni App and is part of the [CyBear Jinni Smart Home](https://github.com/CyBear-Jinni/CBJ_Smart-Home.git) system.

The CyBear Jinni App lets you control and manage the [CyBear Jinni smart devices](https://github.com/CyBear-Jinni/CBJ_Smart-Device.git) through your Android and IOS smartphones.

The CBJ App is written in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and let you control all the CBJ Smart Devices using local Wi-Fi and remotely through Google [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).


## To get the project running

### Attention

* The app is not in the play store so you will need to upload it to your smartphone with a little knowledge about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).


### App preparations:

We need to install the app to your smartphone.

For now the app is not in the play store so install the [flutter project](https://github.com/CyBear-Jinni/CBJ_App/tree/dev/FlutterApp/cybear_jinni_flutter/cybear_jinni_flutter) to your phone manually.


### Connecting the smart device to the CyBear Jinni App:

Find the smart device Wi-Fi IP, it will be something like 10.0.0.12 .

Connect the phone to your home Wi-Fi.

Now we need to link the smart device from inside the phone app.

In the app go to: "Lamps" tab --> Press the cog in the top right corner --> Press the plus button --> Insert the smart device IP and press "Add" --> Change the device name and press the "Update" button --> Press the "Add devices".

That's it.

Now you can control your smart device from the CyBear Jinni App 😁.


## Instructions for developers

The app currently support only Android.
